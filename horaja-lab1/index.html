		<p id="intro">I'm an Information Systems Student at Carnegie Mellon University, from Centerville, Ohio. My academic journey combines technical rigor with practical applications, allowing me to explore the intersection of technology and business solutions. Growing up in the Midwest instilled in me a strong work ethic and collaborative spirit that I bring to every project. At CMU, I've immersed myself in both classroom learning and hands-on experiences through various tech initiatives across campus. My passion lies in developing innovative solutions that address real-world challenges, particularly in data analysis and software development. I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects ranging from AI-powered applications to full-stack web development, constantly pushing the boundaries of my technical abilities. Outside of academics, I enjoy photography, hiking, and participating in hackathons where I can apply my skills in creative ways. My professional experience as a Software Development Intern at Spacepointe Payment Solutions has given me valuable industry insight, while my leadership role with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society taught me the importance of technology in driving social impact. I'm excited about the possibilities that lie at the intersection of information systems and computer science and look forward to contributing to this rapidly evolving field.</p>
